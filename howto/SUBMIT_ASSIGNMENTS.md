## How to Submit SysProg Assignments

1. Assignment solution files must be commited to a git repo that you own and manage yourself
  1. Create a single repo for the course
  1. Create a separate folder in the course repo for each assignement
1. You may use public Github.com (suggested) or private Gitlab via Drexel Tux/Gitlab services (if you wish to use a private repo, we only support Drexel Gitlab)
1. You MUST submit a link to your solution in Blackboard - this signals that are you done with the solution and you are ready for it to be graded
